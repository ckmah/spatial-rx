# milume

**milume: a thinking surface for spatial omics.**

You have a spatial dataset and a hunch. milume turns a notebook cell into a tactile,
reactive surface where you can look at your tissue, select what catches your eye, and
carry that selection straight into code. Cells, landmarks and measurements stay in
plain `AnnData` / `obs_names` / geometry, so what you see on the surface is what you
analyze next.

One call opens it:

```python
import milume

w = milume.peek(adata, color="cell_type")
```

Draw selections and landmarks, color by category or gene, expand neighborhoods, and
read everything back in Python. The name comes from *mille* (thousand, as in
mille-feuille, layers) + *lume* (light).

## Install

```bash
pip install milume
```

### Migrate from spatial-rx

Note: Milume was formerly `spatial-rx`. The API is unchanged; only the names moved:

```bash
pip uninstall spatial-rx
pip install milume
```

```python
import milume   # was: import spatial_rx
```

## Alongside other viewers

Milume complements other viewers. Use `milume` to form intuition: layer images, cells,
and transcripts in a notebook, select what stands out, and carry the selection straight
into your analysis code. Use heavier viewers when you need to inspect in depth.
Landmarks and selections round-trip as plain geometry and `obs_names`, so you can hand
the same regions to any viewer.

From source:

```bash
uv sync --extra demo --group dev
```

`milume.peek(data, **kwargs)` opens the surface on your data and returns a widget `w`
you read results from.

```python
import milume

w = milume.peek(adata, color="cell_type")   # AnnData with obsm["spatial"]
w = milume.peek(sdata, color="cell_type")   # SpatialData on disk: adds the 3D cube
```

| Argument | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `data` | `AnnData` with `obsm["spatial"]`, or a `SpatialData` |
| `color` | `obs` column to color cells by |
| `genes` | gene(s) to expose for coloring; limits the catalog on large matrices |
| `spatial_key` | `obsm` key holding coordinates (default `"spatial"`) |
| `table`, `image`, `labels` | override what is inferred from a `SpatialData` |
| `contrast_limits` | display range for the 3D image |

- From a SpatialData, the widget finds the table, the labels element it annotates, a 3D image on the same grid, and their µm frame (override with `table=`, `image=`, `labels=`; `contrast_limits=` for the image).
- Press **I** (Inspect): hovering shows a live coarse preview of the tissue under the cursor, and a click places a 300 µm window; on release a full-resolution cube of it takes over the plot area, colored like the map, with your landmarks drawn on top and the tissue around the window shown dimmed. Esc or Close returns to the map; leaving Inspect closes the cube. The side panels' peek tabs stay over the cube, so you can focus a category or Selection to color it.
- **Save** in the cube's top-right actions adds the window as an **inspect selection** to its history strip. Read the inspected cells back with `w.get_obs_names(adata, "<inspect id>")` or `w.selections`.
- Hold **Space** to pan in any tool.

Read results back in Python:

| Need | Call |
| --- | --- |
| Cells in a selection | `w.get_obs_names(adata, selection_id)`, `w.assign_obs_mask(adata, key, selection_id)` |
| Landmarks as geometry | `landmarks_to_geodataframe(w.landmarks)` |
| Measure against landmarks | `distances`, `composition`, `along_positions` (+ `write_obs`) |
| Compare a subset with the tissue | `enrichment(adata, obs_names, obs_key=...)` |
| XY vs 3D neighbors | `nearest_distances(adata, seeds, obs_key=...)` (needs `obsm["spatial"]` x, y, z) |
| Map colors for other plots | `w.category_colors("cell_type")` |
| Inspect window and cube cut | `w.inspect_cx`, `w.inspect_cy`, `w.inspect_size_um`; `w.volume_cut` = x0, x1, y0, y1, z0, z1 µm (intersect X/Y with the window for the shown box) |

Large expression matrices are sent sparse; pass `genes=` to limit the gene
catalog.
