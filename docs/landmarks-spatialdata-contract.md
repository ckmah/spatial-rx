# Landmarks ↔ GeoDataFrame contract (M1)

Binding contract for durable landmark annotations. Implements
[GitHub #26](https://github.com/ckmah/spatial-rx/issues/26) / M1.1.
Vocabulary: [`CONTEXT.md`](../CONTEXT.md).

## Scope

| Object | Durable as GeoDataFrame? | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Landmark** | Yes | Source of truth for annotations after commit |
| **Selection** | No (M1) | Analysis region; hits via `obs_names` |

Do not hook GeoDataFrame export to the `selections` traitlet.

The widget does **not** hold a SpatialData object. Notebooks convert
`w.landmarks` ↔ GeoDataFrame with pure helpers and assign into SpatialData
themselves if desired.

## Coordinate system

- Landmark coordinates are **data / tissue coordinates**, the same space as
  `AnnData.obsm["spatial"]` (typically µm or pixel units of the scatter).
- When placing the GeoDataFrame into SpatialData, use the **same coordinate
  system** as the table / points used to build the widget scatter. Do not invent
  a second CRS for landmarks.
- Y-up vs image Y-down follows whatever the widget already uses for
  `obsm["spatial"]` (no silent flip on write/read).

## Public API

```python
from spatial_rx import landmarks_to_geodataframe, geodataframe_to_landmarks

gdf = landmarks_to_geodataframe(w.landmarks)       # may be empty
w.landmarks = geodataframe_to_landmarks(gdf)       # [] if empty

# Optional — notebook-owned SpatialData:
sdata["landmarks"] = gdf
```

Default element name when storing in SpatialData: `landmarks`.

## Required columns (properties)

| Column | Type | Required | Role |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| geometry | GeoPandas geometry | yes | See geometry mapping |
| `id` | string | yes | Stable landmark id (matches widget `landmarks[].id`) |
| `type` | string | yes | One of `point`, `line`, `spline`, `shape` |
| `tension` | float | no | Cardinal tension for `spline` / `shape` (default `0`) |
| `buffer_width` | float | no | Buffer width in data units (default `0`) |
| `buffer_side` | string | no | `left` \| `both` \| `right` (default `both`) |

Optional UI-only fields (`hidden`, colors) may be omitted from the durable
table; round-trip of **id / type / geometry / tension / buffer_*** is
required for M1.

## Geometry mapping (widget → GeoDataFrame)

Widget landmarks store **control** geometry in `vertices` (list of `[x, y]` in
data coords). That JSON column is the round-trip source of truth.

The `geometry` column is a GIS-facing approximation:

| `type` | GeoPandas geometry | Geometry rule | Control vertices |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `point` | `Point` (+ `radius` column, default `1.0`) | First vertex | JSON `vertices` |
| `line` | `LineString` | Polyline through `vertices` (not densified) | JSON `vertices` |
| `spline` | `LineString` | Cardinal sample of control `vertices` (`tension`; same densify as measure) | JSON `vertices` (controls only) |
| `shape` | `Polygon` | Closed ring from control `vertices` | JSON `vertices` (+ `tension` column) |

On read: rebuild widget dicts from `id`, `type`, JSON `vertices`, and optional
`tension` / `buffer_width` / `buffer_side`. **Never** treat densified spline
`LineString` coordinates as new control points when `vertices` is present — that
would re-sample on every export and degenerate the curve.

If `vertices` is missing: `Point` → point; `Polygon` → shape ring; `LineString`
→ polyline **`line`** (even if `type` was `spline`), so a later export does not
densify again.

Note: SpatialData `ShapesModel` historically accepts `Point` / `Polygon` /
`MultiPolygon` only. Callers placing this GeoDataFrame into SpatialData should
use an element type that accepts `LineString`, or keep the table as a standalone
GeoDataFrame.

## Round-trip invariants

Given widget landmarks `L`:

1. `gdf = landmarks_to_geodataframe(L)`.
2. `L' = geodataframe_to_landmarks(gdf)`.
3. For each landmark, equal: `id`, `type`, control
   `vertices` (float-close), and present optional buffer/tension fields.
4. Repeating steps 1–2 does not change control `vertices` (no densify-on-import).

Empty `landmarks` ↔ empty GeoDataFrame (same columns, zero rows). Empty /
missing input to `geodataframe_to_landmarks` yields `[]`.

## Non-goals (this contract)

- Writing **selections** into a GeoDataFrame / SpatialData
- Widget-owned SpatialData attach / auto-save
- Neighborhood edges / type-neighborhood rows as shapes
- Image, labels, or molecule layers
- Standalone app packaging

## Implementation notes (for M1.2)

- Pure functions only: `landmarks_to_geodataframe` / `geodataframe_to_landmarks`.
- Prove the contract with pytest round-trips (TDD).
- Depend on GeoPandas + shapely only where the IO path needs it (optional import
  pattern matching the rest of the package).
